## Usage
Run the Roulette desktop app locally or build distributables from this repository.

Inside the app you can:

- Add new ones with a price and color, edit or delete them;
- Switch weighting modes to flip between inverted odds and classic proportional odds;
- Turn elimination mode on or off;
- Set how long each spin lasts.

## Development

### Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20 LTS or newer (Electron 37 ships with Node 22; using Node ‚â•20 locally prevents tooling mismatches).
- npm 10+ (bundled with Node) or another compatible package manager.

### Setup
Install project dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

### Run the desktop app in watch mode
```sh
npm start
```
This launches Electron Forge, which starts Vite for the renderer and rebuilds the main process on changes.

### Package build
To produce installable artifacts for your platform, run:
```sh
npm run make
```
Electron Forge outputs installers and archives to the `out/` directory. Use `npm run package` if you only need an unpacked app bundle.

### Code quality scripts
- `npm run lint` ‚Äì run ESLint across the project.
- `npm run format` ‚Äì check formatting with Prettier.
- `npm run format:write` ‚Äì apply Prettier fixes in-place.

## Contributing
### Reporting issues
- Search existing GitHub issues before opening a new one to avoid duplicates.
- Include reproduction steps, screenshots or screen recordings when possible, plus your OS and app version (`npm start` vs packaged build).
- Label feature ideas clearly so we can distinguish them from bug reports.

### Pull requests
- Fork the repository, create a feature branch, and keep changes focused on one fix or enhancement.
- Run `npm test` and `npm run lint` before submitting; include new tests when you change behaviour.
- Describe the motivation, the solution, and any follow-up work in the PR template. Cross-link related issues so reviewers have full context.

### Why did you develop this project?
The application was developed for a streamer because there were no suitable tools available on the market.
